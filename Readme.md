hangman rules
A random word is chosen as the answer and displayed as underscores for each letter, representing the unknown letters.

The player must guess letters to fill in the blanks in the word. They can do this by clicking on the LetterButton components, which represent each letter of the alphabet.

If the player guesses a letter that is not in the answer, the Gallows component is updated to show a new body part of the hanging man. The player can make up to 10 incorrect guesses before the game is over.

If the player correctly guesses a letter, the guessed letters are displayed in the correct positions in the word.

The game is won when the player correctly guesses all the letters in the answer before making 10 incorrect guesses.

The game is over when the player has made 10 incorrect guesses and has not correctly guessed all the letters in the answer. A help button is also included in the game ui
